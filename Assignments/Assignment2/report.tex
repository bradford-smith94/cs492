\end{center}

I expected FIFO to perform the worst, Clock to follow and LRU to be the best in both situations.
For demand paging I expected results to start with a high number of page faults at lower page sizes and decrease as page size increased.
For pre-paging I expected results to start lower than the starting results of demand paging and decrease from there.
What actually happened at first seemed to match my expectations.
Demand paging results started high then decreased with the strange effect being that FIFO and Clock increased from page size 8 to 16.
Pre-paging results started much lower than the start of demand paging and started to decrease; however, for FIFO and Clock the decreasing ended in a sharp increase which ended up being almost worse than the worst demand paging results.
Pre-paging with LRU produced different results with an almost steady (although slight) decline as page size increased until it increased from page size 8 to 16.

\smallskip
The first mismatch between my expectations and my results (demand FIFO and Clock going up from 8 to 16 page size) is likely the result of B\'{e}l\'{a}dy's Anomaly.
B\'{e}l\'{a}dy's Anomaly is commonly experienced when using the FIFO algorithm, and since clock is a variant of FIFO it makes sense that both exhibit the pattern.
The second mismatch in expectation (pre-paging FIFO and Clock having dramatic increase) is likely attributed to B\'{e}l\'{a}dy's Anomaly as well, exacerbated by the fact that pre-paging pulls two pages for each fault.
The increase in faults for pre-paging LRU from 8 to 16 page size is the most interesting difference between my expectations and my results.
Even in my results one can see how LRU showed a constant decrease in faults when using demand paging, so it would seem like a valid estimation that a similar trend might be seen when using pre-paging.
Since LRU will not exhibit B\'{e}l\'{a}dy's Anomaly my guess is that this increase is the result of fragmentation occurring in memory.
More memory means that pages are kept in memory longer and have an increased chance of being dropped as ``Least Recently Used'' right before it gets used again.

\smallskip
All three algorithms were fairly simple to implement.
LRU is probably the simplest, when accessed a page is updated with a timestamp (cycle count in the case of my program).
Then when doing a page swap a simple linear search is used to find the page with the lowest timestamp, that page is removed and a new one is loaded.
FIFO is probably second in regard to the other two, each page table maintains a FIFO that keeps track of when pages were loaded.
When a swap is done the FIFO pops off the page that was loaded first and a new one is pushed onto the end.
Clock is the most complex, because it involved implementing FIFO and keeping track of access times.
Implementing the clock algorithm involved making the same FIFO structure, and also keeping a ``bit'' that gets set to 1 each time the page is accessed.
When a swap is done the FIFO is popped, but if the referenced ``bit'' is one the page is re-added to the FIFO with a reference ``bit'' of 0, if the bit was 0 then it is popped and a new page is pushed.

\smallskip
A random memory access trace would definitely change the results shown here.
The results for demand paging would likely be very similar in terms of trend; however, page faults would probably increase across all swapping methods.
The results for pre-paging, on the other hand, would likely become much worse, since pre-paging swaps in the next contiguous page with each page fault.
This is likely to result in memory becoming cluttered with pages that may not be accessed right away if at all.
